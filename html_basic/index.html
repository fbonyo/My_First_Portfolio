    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is my very first webpage, created as part of my journey into web development. I am learning the basics of HTML, which is the foundation of all websites. It's exciting to see how simple tags can build a structured page.</p>

    <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language, but a markup language used to create the structure of a web page. Think of it as the skeleton of a website.</p>

    <h3>Key Elements of a Webpage</h3>
    <p>Some of the most important tags I've learned about so far include `<h1>` for main titles, `<p>` for paragraphs, and `<img>` for images. I am also learning about semantic HTML, which helps make web pages more accessible and easier for search engines to understand.</p>

    <p>There are many more tags to explore, and I am excited to continue building on this foundational knowledge to create more complex and engaging web experiences.</p>
